          <p>Cheers in a mobile app concept developed around the idea of a drink delivery app.
            There are a lot of food delivery apps but very rarely are there establishments like coffee shops, bubble tea shops,
            and shops that specialize with drinks on these apps.

            <br><br>At <a class="textLink" href="http://www.sozentech.com/" target="_blank">SozenTech</a> we wanted to test out
            this idea of a drink delivery app to see if it’s desired by the people, as well as try to remix the process of delivery.

          <p>For this project we adopted a design-sprint approach to get some initial direction in the project
            and to also try different ideas while gaining valuable user insight.<br><br>
            On the first day of our sprint we wanted to build a solid foundation for the rest of our week.
            As a team, we started out with setting our long term goals and sprint questions for the project. </p><br>

            <p>We started out with a lot of Sprint Questions but we eventually narrowed it down to what we felt were
              the most important questions that we wanted answered by the end of the week. These questions were:</p>

            <p>After setting the stage for our project,
              we drew out our map to get a better idea of how people usually get their drinks on the daily.</p>

            <p>Once we’ve established our map we moved on to asking the experts, writing down “How Might We” questions,
              and voting on which ones we liked and placing it on our map.
              We thought that there were very many "HMW" questions that were really interesting but we decided that the questions which
              fit our Sprint Questions well were:</p>

        <div class="col-11 col-lg-5">
          <p>Taking the top questions and placing it on our map,
            we decided that for this sprint our targets for the following day would be the customer and our target event
            will be when they take other people’s orders.</p>

          <p>When it came to solutions we decided to deviate away from a typical design sprint.
            Since we had a lot of different ideas that we felt had a good chance of addressing our sprint questions, as well as help us achieve our long term goal,
            we decided to sketch each of our ideas and expand on them with the purpose of being able to test each idea at the end of the week.</p>

        <div class="col-11 col-md-8 col-lg-5 mt-3">
          <h2 class="montB lgTxt caseH3 mb-4">Sketch</h2>
          <p>For my solution I really wanted to test a different kind of idea. One which develops a relationship between the deliverer
            and the customer. I also really wanted to create a solution that would directly address the sprint question of whether people
            really cared who would deliver their drink to them and if that would either improve their experience, have no effect, or make it worse.
            The reason why I wanted to know if the deliverer mattered was because I wanted to see if people would think of the process of
            delivery in a different way, or if the customer would change their behaviour because of their relationship with the deliverer.
            <br><br>
            With these in mind I wanted to create a solution that would also address the other sprint questions as well as a solution
            that can contribute to our long term goals. Two variations of my solutions sketches were:</p>

        <div class="col-11 col-md-8 col-lg-6">
          <h2 class="montB lgTxt caseH3 mb-4">The Interviews</h2>
          <p>For interviews we decided to try the prototype with people who work and regularly drink coffee/tea. We wanted to test the prototype with people who work because most people drink their coffee/tea before they head to work, during lunch,
            or when they're working.
            We also wanted people who drink coffee/tea because -after water- coffee/tea make up a large percentage of the most consumed beverage
            around the world.
            <br><br>
            During the interviews we gave people a run down of what the app was all about and basically just asked them to see if they can order a Caffè Latte.
            For the most part, people that really liked the concept were people that work in offices. One said that,
            "It makes it easier to ask people what they want to drink without the fear of getting it wrong." and another said that,
            "It alleviates that fear of me asking and interrupting them. I can see myself opening up the request and they can join on their own."
            <br><br>
            While office workers seemed to like the concept, others, those who work from home, not so much.
            Not so much because while the idea of knowing who is delivering your drink is nice and helps them with their peace of mind,
            having someone open up a delivery whilst they're working alone would seem very rare.
            One participant said, "I would be thrilled if my dog could open a group and have them ask me if I want tea delivered to me."
          </p><br>
        </div>
        <div class="col-11 col-md-8 col-lg-6 mt-3">
          <h2 class="montB lgTxt caseH3 mb-4">The Takeaways</h2>
          <p>From observing and interviewing, we found out that even though this solution takes a different approach to delivery,
            it definitely needs more thought, iteration, and work to make it...work.
            Work in a sense that it's aligned with the goals we set as a team.
            <br><br>
            Since this solution didn't work well with people who worked at home, or usually are alone when they buy drinks, we would already be excluding a large part of
            the customers who buy drinks from shops. This wouldn't align with our long term goals because we wouldn't be
            enabling them to get drinks delivered to them. In addition, excluding them wouldn't help us create a solid customer base because the app's use
            would be too circumstantial. They would need someone to open the request, and if those people aren't close by, they would have to
            want to travel to deliver the drinks.
          </p><br>
          <h3 class="montB caseH3">What happens now?</h3>
          <p>For <a class="textLink" href="http://www.sozentech.com/" target="_blank">SozenTech</a>, probably not an idea worth pursuing.
          For me, an awesome experience. I had fun! I thought it was cool to try a modified version of a Design Sprint,
          make a prototype in a week, testing multiple ideas with real people and seeing what they really thought.
          If I were to pursue this idea later in the future, some of the things I would have to do would be to put more thought on how to make the process
        less circumstantial as well as delve deeper into the minds of the thirsty people of the world.</p>
